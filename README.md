Using commands such as `.gen`, people can generate accounts, codes or other similar things. 

You put bunch of lines a text file and if a user uses one of the commands mentioned before they can generate the lines. This is mostly used for accounts

It takes a random line from the text file and sends it to the user (of course it deletes the line as well, so there won't be any duplicates)
